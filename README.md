# Epub Web Reader
I was unable to find an epub reader that works well with Microsoft Edge's read aloud feature so I decided to build one myself. Bear in mind that this is a work in progress 👷‍♂️
# Setup
download and install Python and pip packages flask and ebooklib. I recommend a venv virtual environment.
